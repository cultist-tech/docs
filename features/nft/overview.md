# Overview



## NFT USE Cases 2022&#x20;

**In 2022, NFT has acquired many new application options and not all of them are obvious:**

1. The most popular is PFP (picture for proof and profile pic), many learned about NFT and cryptocurrency thanks to these pictures, because even the stars started using them as avatars in their social networks, or for example Eminem went further and used one of the BAYC not only as an avatar, but also in one of the his music clips
2. Art — has lost its former relevance, but is still in demand, examples can serve as artists PAK, Beeple and others.
3. Investments — the items of the NFT collection can serve as a share in the company, and the investments of this company will bring income to the owners of these NFTs
4. NFT can also be a membership card of some closed community or DAO, where the creator and participants share alpha information, make decisions together on the development of the project, help each other in various aspects. Can be additionally used for any NFT collections, as BAYC did
5. Brand advertising — the best example is Nike/RTFKT and Adidas, which have entered into excellent partnerships with the leaders of the NFT sphere and successfully advertise their brand, providing the opportunity to exchange some of their NFT for real things, such as sneakers.
6. Game items — often they have only in-game use for P2E mechanics, but in addition, you can always use any other option from this list
7. Virtual Earth — it is already a generally accepted fact that metaverses are our future. What can we talk about if one of the leaders of the traditional market, Mark Zuckerberg, has started working in this direction. And everyone, as in real life, wants a piece of land, or housing. Many large companies have already acquired land in Sandbox. And this direction is only at the beginning of his life
8. DeFi is a hype of 2021, NFT with such use needs to be staked to get a project token, or they open access to exclusive defi farms
9. Music is a huge market that has also managed to touch NFT and many artists have already tried themselves in this. At the moment, this direction is poorly developed, but this is just the beginning and using NFT for music is at least unusual and may attract additional attention
