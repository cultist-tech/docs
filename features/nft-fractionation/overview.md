# Overview

Player collect certain NTF to exchange them for another specific NFT from any collection. For example: a unique sword is created in the game, but it can only be obtained by collecting all its parts (blade, hilt). This motivates users to search for the necessary NFT parts, offer to buy them out to the holders of the parts themselves. And a user who has collected all the details and exchanged them for the same unique item can get special opportunities.
