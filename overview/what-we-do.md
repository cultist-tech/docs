# ðŸ’¡ What we do

We are a team working to bring GameFi solutions closer to the people.&#x20;

We have a very ambitious goal - to improve the experience of GameDev teams in quickly and easily integrating game projects into blockchain, increasing the various possibilities for monetizing games. GameDev is facing many different paths, from custom NFT hero capabilities to tournaments and prizes.&#x20;

We are building a smart contract constructor that can help to develop a first but functional and well-integrated smart contract of your game. We create general and special features according to game scenarios that can be easily implemented in the blockchain of your project. We provide a basic smart contract that can easily, with a simple line of code, be extended with the appropriate features that you think are best suited for your game. Here we describe our basic features, and highlight their implementation and possibilities.&#x20;

Sit back and find the best features you like!
